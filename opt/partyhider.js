- dashed line with party messages over the entire chat length
  (you know which ones I mean)
- [MVP+] randomBingoer has disconnected, they have 5 minutes to rejoin before they are removed from the party.
- [MVP+] randomBingoer was removed from your party because they disconnected.
- [MVP+] randomBingoer has left the party.
and maybe even default-enable
- [MVP+] randomBingoer joined the party.
and potentially?? (but good to have maybe, I guess?!):
- [MVP++] randomSpammer has been removed from the party.
